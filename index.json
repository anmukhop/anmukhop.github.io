In order to address the issue, we propose a flagging mechanism that modifies the process of reporting currently found in popular platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. The feature combats trolling through collaboration and by allowing bystanders and content creators to provide feedback that can help develop a shared understanding of community guidelines.
