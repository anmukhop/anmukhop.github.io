      <title>Expert-led crowdsourcing in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Investigations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Developed a framework for students trained in social media information discovery and verification skills to augment the investigative practices of journalists, law enforcement officers, and human rights activists. I ran five study sessions where students contributed to real-world investigations being carried out by the experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used design-based research (DBR) approach to develop the collaborative framework. Data collection was in the form of collaborative spreadsheets containing feedback from experts, semi-structured interviews with students and experts, and student reflection assignments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work is in preparation for CHI 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Collaboration and competition in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) analysis</title>
      <link>https://anmukhop.github.io/project/collaboration-and-competition-in-open-source-intelligence-osint-analysis/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 23:46:53 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://anmukhop.github.io/project/collaboration-and-competition-in-open-source-intelligence-osint-analysis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Developed a web app for students to participate in Capture the Flag (CTF) events to discover, archive, verify and report possible social media misinformation. The Quriosinty app was used by 40 students every week during the Spring &amp;lsquo;21 semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here users can form teams, submit pieces of investigation through flags and judges can award points based on a rubric. I built REST API endpoints to extend the platform for integrating new OSINT tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used a Research through Design (RtD) process to iterate on the platform and generate design recommendations for systems aimed at verification of online information. Data was collected from system logs, student reflections, and semi-structured interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper will be submitted to CSCW 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Explorable Interactive Human Reposing</title>
      <link>https://anmukhop.github.io/project/explorable-interactive-human-reposing/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 03:53:18 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://anmukhop.github.io/project/explorable-interactive-human-reposing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Design&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first allow the user to read an image and we display the uploaded image to the user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then extract the pose from the body joint detection algorithm (OpenPose (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Hzzone/pytorch-openpose&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://github.com/Hzzone/pytorch-openpose&lt;/a&gt;)) and get two arrays (subset and candidate) representing the pose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We map these ambiguous arrays (subset and candidate) into a user understandable body joint skeleton and display them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We make the joints interactable, where users can drag and drop joints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We allow the user to click &amp;ldquo;replot&amp;rdquo; to get the final pose they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We map the edited pose back into the ambiguous arrays (subset and candidate) to be passed into the reposing model (CoCosNet-v2 (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/microsoft/CoCosNet-v2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://github.com/microsoft/CoCosNet-v2&lt;/a&gt;)) to synthesize the final reposed image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We allow the user to use an image whose pose they like for pose extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We add &amp;ldquo;evaluate&amp;rdquo; button that will evaluate the accuracy of respecting the desired pose by utilizing the following metrics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average keypoint distance (AKD): the average distance between the pose keypoint of the output image and the input pose keypoint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missing keypoint rate (MKR): the number of pose keypoints not detected in the generated image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Red Flags: Combating ad hominem attacks in comment-based online discussions</title>
      <link>https://anmukhop.github.io/project/red-flags-combating-ad-hominem-attacks-in-comment-based-online-discussions/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Trolling in social media has become a serious social issue. In this study, we aim to understand the needs of social media users who have experienced and witnessed trolling. Based on ethnographic interviews, we found that victims feel isolated and hurt among other psychological effects due to ad hominem attacks during online discourse. In order to address the issue, we propose a flagging mechanism that modifies the process of reporting currently found in popular platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. The feature combats trolling through collaboration and by allowing bystanders and content creators to provide feedback that can help develop a shared understanding of community guidelines. We develop a prototype and perform user studies to evaluate the flagging feature. Semi-structured interviews combined with a small-scale user study establish that the proposed UI control on comment threads is able to make users feel supported when they encounter problematic content on the prototype platform.&lt;/p&gt;
