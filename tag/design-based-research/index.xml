      <description>&lt;p&gt;Developed a framework for students trained in social media information discovery and verification skills to augment the investigative practices of journalists, law enforcement officers, and human rights activists. I ran five study sessions where students contributed to real-world investigations being carried out by the experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used design-based research (DBR) approach to develop the collaborative framework. Data collection was in the form of collaborative spreadsheets containing feedback from experts, semi-structured interviews with students and experts, and student reflection assignments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work is in preparation for CHI 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
